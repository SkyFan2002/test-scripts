Temp repo for various test scripts.


The test scripts in this repository were originally intended to be temporary. 
However, in practice, they proved to be quite useful and were thus retained. 


Currently, the code contains a significant amount of duplication and informal handling. 
Moving forward, it will be progressively refined based on specific testing and quality assurance requirements.
